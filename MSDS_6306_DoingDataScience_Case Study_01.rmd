[Link to the Github Repository Associated with this Study](https://github.com/davxdan/MSDS_6306_DoingDataScience_Case-Study_01)

The purpose of this is to present findings from blah blah ....
The questions asked are listed below with data analysis methods and answers.  

### The Data Provided
Data was provided in the form of w .csv files which are included in the repository path...



```{r, tidy=TRUE}
#Load Beers.csv into a dataframe
UrlAddress<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davxdan/MSDS_6306_DoingDataScience_Case-Study_01/master/Input/RawDataFiles/Beers.csv"
DataURL<- getURL(UrlAddress)
RawBeerData<-read.table(textConnection(DataURL),fill = TRUE, sep=",", quote = "",header=TRUE)

#Load Breweries.csv
UrlAddress<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davxdan/MSDS_6306_DoingDataScience_Case-Study_01/master/Input/RawDataFiles/Breweries.csv"
DataURL<- getURL(UrlAddress)
RawBreweryData<-read.table(textConnection(DataURL),fill = TRUE, sep=",", quote = "",header=TRUE)


print(RawBreweryData[c(111, 112),]) #Identified erroneous record
#RawBreweryData$Brew_ID[RawBreweryData$ == ""Woodstock Inn"]<-"South Korea" #For numbers do same except no quotes ""
#y2016 <- subset(x = RawBreweryData, Brew_ID != 110,111)
RawBreweryData<-RawBreweryData[-c(111, 112),]
```
###1. How many breweries are present in each state?
```{r, tidy=TRUE}

CountBreweriesByState<-table(RawBreweryData$State)

```
###2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the ﬁrst 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged ﬁle.

###3. Report the number of NA’s in each column.

###4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

###5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

###6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.

###7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot. You are welcome to use the ggplot2 library for graphs. Please ignore missing values in your analysis. Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
