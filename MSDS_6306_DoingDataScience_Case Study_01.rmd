## Brewery Data Analysis

[Link to the Github Repository Associated with this Study](https://github.com/davxdan/MSDS_6306_DoingDataScience_Case-Study_01)

The purpose of this is to present findings from blah blah ....
The questions asked are listed below with data analysis methods and answers.  

### The Data Provided
Load Beers.csv
```{r, tidy=TRUE}
RawBeerData <- read_csv("Input/RawDataFiles/Beers.csv")
```
Load Breweries.csv
```{r, tidy=TRUE}
RawBreweryData <- read_csv("Input/RawDataFiles/Breweries.csv")
```
###1. How many breweries are present in each state?
The record (110,"Woodstock Inn, Station & Brewery",North Woodstock, NH) was causing errors but readr fixed this.
Identify the records:
```{r}
RawBreweryData[c(110, 111, 112),] #Identified erroneous records
```
```{r}
Stage1BreweryData<- RawBreweryData
Stage1BreweryData <-transform(Stage1BreweryData, State = as.character(State))
```
```{r, tidy=TRUE}
CountBreweriesByState<-data.frame(Stage1BreweryData$State)
summary(CountBreweriesByState,maxsum=100)
```
###2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the ﬁrst 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged ﬁle.

###3. Report the number of NA’s in each column.

###4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

###5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

###6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.

###7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot. You are welcome to use the ggplot2 library for graphs. Please ignore missing values in your analysis. Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
